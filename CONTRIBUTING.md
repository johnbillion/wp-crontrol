## Releasing a New Version

These are the steps to take to release a new version of WP Crontrol (for contributors who have push access to the GitHub repo).

### Prior to Release

1. Check [the milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/milestones) for open issues or PRs. Fix or reassign as necessary.
1. If this is a non-patch release, check issues and PRs assigned to the patch or minor milestones that will get skipped. Reassign as necessary.
1. Ensure you're on the `develop` branch and all the changes for this release have been merged in.
1. Ensure `readme.md` contains up to date descriptions, "Tested up to" versions, FAQs, screenshots, etc.
1. Ensure `.gitattributes` is up to date with all files that shouldn't be part of the build.
   - To do this, export the archive then check the contents for files that shouldn't be part of the package:

         git archive --output=wp-crontrol.zip HEAD

1. Run the tests and ensure everything passes:

       composer test

1. Prepare a changelog for [the Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/releases).

### For Release

1. Install the Node dependencies:

       npm install

1. Bump the plugin version number:
   - For a patch release (1.2.3 => 1.2.4):

         npm run bump:patch

   - For a minor release (1.2.3 => 1.3.0):

         npm run bump:minor

   - For a major release (1.2.3 => 2.0.0):

         npm run bump:major

1.     git push origin develop
1. Wait until (and ensure that) [the tests pass](https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/actions)
1.     git checkout master
1.     git merge develop
1.     git push origin master
1.     git push origin master:release
1. Wait for [the Build Release action](https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/actions/workflows/build.yml) to complete
1. Enter the changelog into [the release on GitHub](https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/releases) and publish it.

### Post Release

Publishing a release on GitHub triggers an action which deploys the release to the WordPress.org Plugin Directory. No need to touch Subversion.

New milestones are automatically created for the next major, minor, and patch releases where appropriate.

1. Close the milestone.
1. If this is a non-patch release, manually delete any [unused patch and minor milestones on GitHub](https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/milestones).
1. Approve the release on [the WordPress.org release management dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/releases/).
1. Check the new version has appeared [on the WordPress.org plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/).
1. Resolve relevant threads on [the plugin's support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-crontrol/).
1. Consume tea and cake as necessary.

### Asset Updates

Assets such as screenshots and banners are stored in the `.wordpress-org` directory. These get deployed as part of the automated release process too.

In order to deploy only changes to assets, push the change to the `deploy` branch and they will be deployed if they're the only changes in the branch since the last release. This allows for the "Tested up to" value to be bumped as well as assets to be updated in between releases.
