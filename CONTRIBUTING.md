## Setting up Locally

You can clone this repo and activate it like a normal WordPress plugin. If you want to contribute to WP Crontrol, you should install the developer dependencies in order to run the tests.

### Prerequisites

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 24
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or compatible) to run the tests

### Setup

Install the PHP dependencies:

	composer install

Install the Node.js dependencies:

	npm install

## Running the Tests

The test suite consists of:

* Acceptance tests using Playwright
* Integration tests using PHPUnit
* Linting using PHPCS
* Static analysis using PHPStan

The acceptance and integration tests run in a container. Ensure Docker Desktop is running before running the tests.

To run the whole test suite:

	composer test

To run tests individually, run one of:

	composer test:phpcs
	composer test:phpstan
	composer test:integration
	composer test:acceptance

To run a single test:

	composer test:acceptance -- tests/acceptance/AddEvent.spec.ts

The individual integration and acceptance tests require the Docker containers to be running. To start and stop them, use:

	composer test:start
	composer test:stop
